# Symptom-Checker
Developed a Flask-based Symptom Checker application as part of a university project, allowing users to input symptoms and receive relevant health-related suggestions. The system utilizes an SQLite database to store and analyze symptom data, providing a structured approach to symptom tracking and helping users identify potential health concerns.
